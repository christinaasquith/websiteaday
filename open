<h1>The Next Day</h1>
<p>Here's what I learned today</p>
<!-- adding hotlinks and images -->
<p>Every day I'll post a new site including new stuff I learned going through <a href="https://www.learnenough.com/"> Michael Hartle's tutorial</a>. At the same time, I'm putting <span style="font-style: normal; font-size:24px; font-weight:bold; color:#ff000;"> freshly made bread</span> in the over. That means I only have 30 mins to build this site every morning while the dough is cooking, plus a bonus 15 minutes with the lid off the Dutch oven. </p>
<img src="bread.jpg" alt="baked bread" height="200px" style="float: left" margin:100px;>
<p>    At the end, I'll have practiced new CSS and HTML, plus command line, Git, VIM and text editors. Plus I'll have new bread.</p>
